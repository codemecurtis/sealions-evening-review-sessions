# SF Sea Lions 2015 Evening Review Sessions

The purpose of this repo is to allow a leader or group of leaders to meet with a group of people in the evening to help solidify a learning competency that you or our peers may not understand fully.

There is no limit or minimum for these sessions just as long as we are all learning and understanding better. This is only a idea. *Just remember: This is only a recommendation, in no way is this required!*


### Scheduling

I will communicate with cohort memebers to set a session for each night if time permits ( Open to recommendations, feel free to leave a issue). Once we have a group decision I will list the date, topic and time. If you think it will be better to add your own session please feel free to create a branch push and submit a pull request and I will merge or feel free to merge if there are no conflicts.

```
3/2/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/3/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/4/15 - Yaron Sadka - Git
3/5/15 - Matt McDole - Recursion vs iteration
3/6/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/7/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/8/15 - Take a fucking day off!
```


### Keeping Track of Work ***(Optional)***

I think for people who cannot stay in the evening it would be great if there was any code written or notes if they are digital to create it on a branch and have the opportunity to review the code later. After you clone this repo you can create a new branch:

```git checkout -b session_name-session_leader```<br>
***i.e. (git checkout -b binary_search-matt_mcdole)***

Makes some changes and when you push your new branch you can:

1) submit a pull request & merge <br>
2) send me an email and I will merge your branch into master.
