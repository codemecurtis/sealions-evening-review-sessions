# Sea Lions Evening Review Sessions

The purpose of this repo is to allow a leader or group of leaders to meet with a group of people in the evening to help solidify a learning competency that you may not understand fully.

There is not limit or minimum for session just as long as we are all leaarning and understanding better.


### Scheduling

I will communicate with cohort memebers to set a session for each night if time permits. Once we have a group decision I will list the date, topic and time. If you think it will be better to add your own session please feel free to create a branch push and submit a pull request and I will merge or feel free to merge if there are no conflicts.

```
3/2/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/3/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/4/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/5/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/6/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/7/15 - Leader or Group of leaders - Session topic
3/8/15 - Take a fucking day off!
```


### Keeping track of work

I think for people who cannot stay in the evening it would be great if there was any code written to create it on a branch and have the opportunity to review the code later. After you clone this repo you can greate a new branch

```git checkout -b session_name-session_leader```<br>
i.e. (git checkout -b binary_search-matt_mcdole)

So when you push your new branch you can

1) submit a pull request & merge <br>
2) send me an email and I will merge your branch into master.
